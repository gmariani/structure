<!--STRUCTURE Welcome Welcome to Course Vector!  At Course  Vector we take pride in our ability to  provide you with the quality you are  looking for. We keep you closely  involved during the design process, to  help present your website/services in  the way that has been working for you  over the years. Browse through our  web site and view our services and  you will see why Course Vector is the  right choice for your web site design  needs.   vmOuSOg e l  cBHB iyBa A   Originality We custom design each site to be original.  It won't look like it was just made from a  Frontpage template. We believe your web site should be unique and reflect this to your  visitors. Visitors will become bored with the same look and feel from other web sites  they see while browsing the Internet. By making your web site unique it will stand out  from other sites and keep your visitors coming back and staying longer periods of time.  Course Vector will design a web site that will stand out among your competition. Begninnings Course Vector Media was founded in August  2000 by two high-school juniors.  Our mission  was to provide high quality web sites for a  competitive price.  Explore our portfolio and view  other clients sites.
